# Better Files

A read-only file browser for a person's Herdr window, for directing agents rather than writing code by hand. Judge any addition by whether it helps someone see where an agent has been, read its work, or hand a file on. Editing and file operations stay out.

## What you see

One framed sidebar panel, radius 10, with a 42px header: the plain title Files with the folder's name in a badge, and on the right a folder icon, a menu opening the folder in each editor or Finder (this computer only), and refresh.

Under the header, a filter row, 10px and 8px padding with a rule under it, holds a 28px text box on `input` with radius 8, "Filter files" as its placeholder, a small × while it has text, then the dotfiles and Collapse all buttons. Below is a tree for the focused pane's folder: 26px rows of chevron, icon, name and a Git letter, directories first, with a dot on a folder holding changes. A file or diff tab has no folder, so focusing one leaves the tree where it was.

A click opens the file in one shared centre tab per space, named after the file, or goes to its tab if it's already open. A double-click keeps that tab, and never opens a second. The next click starts a new shared tab.

Image files show fitted to the pane instead of the editor, through a copy in `mods/better-files/cache/`, because `image()` only loads from under Herdr's folder; a space on another machine says it can't show them. The centre tab has one title row, the same as a Better Changes diff: file, folder and Preview while it's the shared one. It publishes that to `shared("pane-heads")`, which Better Changes' pane header shows, and draws its own 30px row only under another header. A Markdown file opens rendered, with Preview and Code beside Keep tab to switch to the file view; the choice is kept per tab, and `settings.markdown` sets the first one. Keep tab and Open in float over the file's top right corner, or sit in that row. Below is the file, read-only, in the code font at the terminals' size.

Right-click opens a popup at the pointer with groups separated by rules: Open and Open in new tab (files); Open in each editor, Open in default app (files) and Show in Finder (this computer only); Show diff (a changed file, with Better Changes installed); Copy relative path and Copy full path; Send to each agent in the space, each also as `<name> (spawn)`, and to a new one of each installed kind.

Choosing an agent opens a box docked at the bottom of the panel with who it goes to, the path, and a prompt that's required. Only Send delivers.

## How it works

One class plays three roles, each its own copy: sidebar, viewer and menu, connected by `shared("better-files.*")`.

A copy can't name its own tab, so each viewer has an ID in a registry, `better-files.viewers`, holding its space, file, whether it's the shared one, and its tab. It records its tab from `focused()` as it opens, never one in the list of tabs that existed when it was asked for, or one another viewer holds. Entries for closed tabs are removed.

The menu closes at once, so it leaves its question in `better-files.compose` for the sidebar to ask.

The message to an agent is the prompt then the path, not the file's text. A running agent gets `hc send`; `(spawn)` runs `hc run --bg --parent <agent> --cwd <folder> <program> <message>` directly, so no shell sees the message; a new agent gets `tab.new` with the message as its first prompt.

Editors are found by macOS app ID with `mdfind`, because a Nix or per-user install isn't in `/Applications`, and opened with `open -b`.

Show diff hands over in the form Better Changes' own list uses: `better-changes.selection` and `better-changes.diff-tabs`, keyed to the Git root, with `tab.new` when no diff tab is open.

Changed lines come from `git diff -U0 HEAD`, with external diff and text conversion off, or all green for an untracked file. Herdr's editor can't mark a line or report its scroll, and marks laid over it slid as it scrolled, so the file is drawn as rows in a `v_virtual_list`, like a Better Changes diff: a 3px bar, the line number, then the code in simple one-line colouring, tinted by its mark, with a thin row holding a 2px red line where lines were removed. Clicking a change that replaced something, through the list's `on_item_click`, shows the old lines in red above it, and its new lines turn green. `settings.gutter: false` uses Herdr's editor instead.

The Markdown preview is gpui-base's `TextView.markdown`, as Herdr's own PR mod uses it, wrapped as `Markdown` in `views/ui.js`, selectable and not scrolling on its own. `markdownBlocks` in `files/model.js` splits the file only where an unindented line is just a local image, outside code fences, so each such picture is copied into the cache and drawn with `image()` like an image file; everything else goes to TextView whole. Links come back through `on_link_click`: `http(s)` goes to `cx.open_url`, a path is resolved from the file's folder and opened as a tree click would, and anchors and other schemes do nothing. The choice is `markdown: "preview" | "code"` on the viewer's registry entry. A tab's copies, its image and its Markdown pictures, are removed when it closes.

The filter needs every file, not just the open folders, so it reads a list once per folder when the box first has text: `git ls-files -z --cached --others --exclude-standard` in the folder, which leaves out what Git ignores, or, outside a repository, `find . -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 12 ( -name .git -o … ) -prune -o ! -type d -print0 | head -c 4000000`, 5 deep at `/`, `/root` or a folder directly under `/home` or `/Users`. The watch marks the list stale, and it's read again on the next refresh, but at most every 5 seconds, with a `cx.timer.after` for the last change of a busy spell, so a folder an agent keeps writing in doesn't run `git ls-files` nonstop. A folder that can't be watched is read again every 30 seconds. The old list shows until the new one is in. `files/filter.js` turns it into files and the folders they're in, keeps up to 40,000, and matches: a name holding the words, case aside, or the path for words with a `/`; names starting with them first, then shorter paths; 200 at most. Matches are drawn with the tree's own rows under their folders, folders first; a folder above a match shows open and dim, and clicking a matching folder clears the box, opens it and its parents in the tree, reading each one there as a chevron click does (a refresh skips a tree that is still loading), and scrolls to it with a `ScrollHandle`. Moving to another folder clears the last one's filter error and the folder still to scroll to. The box's `submit` opens the marked match, else the first matching file, and Escape, through `on_key_down` on its row, clears it.

The tools sit after the box: 22px `IconButton`s with Lucide's `eye` or `eye-off`, and `chevrons-down-up`. Dotfiles are a name starting with a dot, in the tree, and any part of a path starting with one, in the matches; the choice is `localStorage["better-files.dotfiles"]`, shown unless `"false"`. Collapse all empties the open folders, off while filtering or with none open.

The keyboard is a `cx.focus_handle()` tracked by the list, with `on_key_down` on it. A click on a row focuses it, outside the filter, and the `focus` command from `nextCommand()`, bound as `better-files.focus`, focuses it and marks the first row. The marker is a path, not an index, so it survives a refresh; it's drawn as a 1px `accent` border, with a transparent border on every other row so the text doesn't move, and only while the list has the keyboard or the filter box has it with words in it. `visibleRows()` lists the rows on show, as data, for both the drawing and the keys: the tree, without dotfiles if they're off, or the filter's matches. Keys compare `event.keystroke`, so a chord such as `shift-j` passes on. A key the tree doesn't use, and Escape with no marker, go on to Herdr. Moving to another folder clears the marker. New words in the filter clear the marker, and a folder picked from the matches takes the keyboard, marked.

## Built from

`mods/better-files/`: `main.js`, `settings.js` (shared between this repo's mods), `mod.json` (`place: none`, title Better Files), `mod.schema.json` (its settings with their defaults, which the code's `DEFAULT_SETTINGS` must match), `files/` (`model.js`, `reads.js`, `filter.js`), `actions/` (`open.js`, `outside.js`, `agents.js`, `menus.js`), `views/` (`ui.js`, `tree.js`, `filter.js`, `tools.js`, `keys.js`, `viewer.js`, `context-menu.js`), `icons/` (the tools' icons from Lucide, as the rest). Adapted from Herdr's shipped Files mod.

## Watch out

Herdr's shipped layouts are read-only, so the sidebar only shows in a layout the person owns. Never overwrite an unrelated mod on a name clash. `herdr-app check` draws only the sidebar's first frame, so look at the running app too.

## Done when

- `herdr-app check` passes, and the tree lists the focused pane's folder with Git marks.
- Typing in the filter finds a file in a folder that was never opened, from Git's list in a repository; Enter opens it, and Escape brings back the tree as it was.
- Dotfiles hide from the tree and the matches and stay hidden after a restart; Collapse all closes every folder.
- After a click on the tree, the arrows move a marker, Right and Left open and close folders, Enter opens the row, and keys the tree doesn't use still reach Herdr.
- A click reuses one centre tab, a double-click keeps it, and the next click opens another.
- An open file updates when it changes on disk, without losing your place when it hasn't.
- A Markdown file opens rendered, Preview and Code switch it per tab, and its links and pictures work.
- Right-click offers only what applies, and Send to an agent delivers the path.
